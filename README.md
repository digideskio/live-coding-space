A project exploring Live Coding in open spaces.

* I visit an open space in Berlin.
* Live code a piece of music with my laptop there and then.
* Incorporate a sample recorded in the location.
* Publish the source code and piece.
* Leave.

Performed using Sonic Pi: www.sonic-pi.net and the Ruby programming language: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/.

## Open Music

Bringing the culture of open source code to music. 
All the performance source code is there for anyone to look at and learn from.

## Performances:

##### Invalidenfriedhof, Berlin, Mitte: November 2, 2014

One of the oldest cemeteries in Berlin, overlooking the river Spree. 
The Berlin wall cut the cemetry in half.
