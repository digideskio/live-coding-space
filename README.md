A project where: 
* I visit an open space in Berlin.
* Live code a piece of music with my laptop there and then.
* Incorporate a sample recorded in the location.
* Publish the source code and piece.
* Leave.

Performed using Sonic Pi: www.sonic-pi.net and the Ruby programming language: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/.
