A project exploring Live Coding in open spaces.

* I visit an open space in Berlin.
* Live code a piece of music with my laptop there and then.
* Publish the source code and piece.
* Leave.

Performed using Sonic Pi: www.sonic-pi.net and the Ruby programming language: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/.

## Open Music

In the theme of open spaces, the musical source code is open for all to look at and learn from.
Bringing the culture of open source code to music.
